This program allows an admin user to add quotes via the admin.py file which are saved to a txt file.
The admin can also list, search, view and delete any of the added quotes.
A user can then use the quotes.py file to view all of the quotes that have been added by the admins.
This file uses tkinter to create a GUI to showcase the quotes added to the TXT file.
The users can either add a like or love to a quote or they can skip to the next quote.
